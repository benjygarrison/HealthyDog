# HealthyDog
Sample ios app that calculates daily calorific needs for dogs. 

This was developed as a quick project on my day off, just to get some hands-on experience with Swift and building iOS apps. 

It's a basic app that allows user to select their dog's ideal weight in either lbs or kg using a picker-view, and then calculates the daily calorific needs for that dog.

I didn't bother making the layout adjustable, since I wanted to move on to more complex projects, so it currently scales correctly on iPhone 6 through 8. On other models, the UI elements will be all over the place. I may come back to it one day and fix this issue.
